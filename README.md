# GasSimulation

My project is to simulate particles as they interact with each other (e.g. collisions, electric repel/attraction, etc.) and with external forces (e.g. collision with a box, gravitational force, etc.).

The following are required for the project to compile:
- OpenCV (although it is not used yet)
- Eigen (but probably I will drop it,it conflicts with CImg)
- CImg (https://github.com/dtschump/CImg for visualization)
- C++Onnector
